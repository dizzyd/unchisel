# Unchisel

Chiseling in survival mode is a blast—especially when it's cold and snowy outside. But let's be honest: messing up your design or wanting to start over can be a real pain when all those carefully crafted blocks are lost forever.

That's where the Unchisel comes in!

Now, you can create an Unchisel from any default chisel—Copper, Bronze, and beyond. Just place the chisel in a crafting grid to transform it. The Unchisel's durability will scale based on the original tool. It starts with 20% of the input chisel's total durability.

Example: Turn an Tin Bronze Chisel into an Unchisel and get 200 durability, as the input originally had 1000 durability.

Once you have one, simply right-click a chiseled block with the Unchisel to recover the original materials, costing 1 durability per material recovered.

⚠️ Heads-up: Mods like this can sometimes open the door to duplication bugs. While we haven't found any, please report anything weird so we can patch it up quickly!
